## Customization

You can easily customize this contact card to fit your personal brand:

    * Update the `href` attributes for the call, message, and social media links.
    * **Remember to update the GitHub link with your actual profile URL!**
2.  **Replace Images:**
    * Place your `Vishnu.jpg` (profile picture), `instagram.png`, `github.png`, `linkedin.png`, `facebook.png`, and `whatsapp.png` files in the same directory as `Contact-card.html`. Ensure they are appropriately sized and optimized for web.
